Currently Moss Rock Preserve is home to four rare species of plants and a rare variant of Little River Canyon Sandstone Glade - one of only 35 occurrences known around the world! </strong></font>

  <p></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><strong>Moss Rock Preserve's Boulder Field is a favorite among rock climbers. With numerous technical formations, these boulders appeal to climbers of all skill levels. The City of Hoover is fortunate that these and other natural features exist in Moss Rock. As such, Moss Rock Preserve has been dedicated as a nature preserve in order to insure its long-term survivability. 
  </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><strong><br /> 
  Nearly 12 miles of hiking footpaths have been constructed within Moss Rock Preserve. These paths allow visitors and nature enthusiasts to witness the beauty of Moss Rock up close and personal. Trail construction and maintenance as well as other general maintenance items within Moss Rock are being carried out primarily by dedicated groups of volunteers. Groups like the Friends of Moss Rock Preserve; Southeastern Climbers Coalition; Ruffner Mountain Nature Center; Americorps; Boy Scouts of America; Hands on Birmingham; and various church and civic organizations have all graciously dedicated their time to improving Moss Rock. Hoover appreciates each of you! <br />

  </strong></font><br />
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><strong>Possibly the most unique feature of Moss Rock Preserve is that it belongs to the Hoover community. With increased use, Moss Rock will become more and more dependent on this community for its maintenance and general well being. In June of 2003, the City of Hoover adopted Ordinance #03-1973 to aid in the protection and preservation of Moss Rock Preserve. Preserve Rules signs are currently posted at various trail heads around Moss Rock Preserve. Please read them as you enter.

  Visitors are encouraged to report any and all violations of these rules to the Hoover Police Department at 205-822-5300. Please do your part to keep Moss Rock scenic and wild for all generations to enjoy. </strong></font></p>
