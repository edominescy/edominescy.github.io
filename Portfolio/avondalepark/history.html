      <font face="Kreon"><b>Miss Fancy</b></font>
      <p><font face="Kreon" size="-1">Miss Fancy was a loved elephant that inhabited Avondale Park many years ago. Before Avondale Park was a park, it was made into a small zoo. She was well known by residents in the area as she had a reputation for escaping her cage and roaming about the streets. the Age-Herald took credit for presenting the animal as a gift "to the children of Birmingham".  The city constructed a green-painted elephant house at Avondale Park.  She was an early and enduring favorite of the city's children. Miss Fancy was also known to be a drinker, consuming quarts of confiscated whisky provided by city officials during prohibition. The liquor was mixed with the elephant's feed as a treatment for constipation or chills.  This is possibly why the Avondale Brewing company adopted her image as part of their logo in more recent years.</font></p></font><p></p><br /><p></p><font face="Kreon"><b>King's Spring</b></font><p><font face="Kreon" size="-1">King Spring, later called Avondale Spring, was a freshwater spring located in the southern slope of Red Mountain in what is now Avondale Park. After Abner Killough sold the area around the spring to Peyton King it became known by his name. In the early days of Birmingham, water from King's Spring, considered far superior to well-water available in the city, was transported downtown and sold for 25 cents a barrel. The Spring Branch running from the grotto was diverted into parallel ditches on either side of the street and remained open until 1925 when it was channeled into a culvert below the center of the street. Avondale Park was planned around the spring with a rock grotto and low walls surrounding a pool which was used for wading. The spring was sealed off in the 1930s and the wading pond was covered over by the present baseball fields.</font><p></p><br /><p></p><font face="Kreon"><b>Avondale Villa</b></font><p><font face="Kreon" size="-1">The Avondale Villa was constructed in 1931 as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. Once completed, the building was held in very high regard by the whole town and was kept in immaculate condition by the land owner for many years. The building primarily served as a venue for meetings and gatherings and is still used for such means today. There were considerations to renovate the Villa in 1974-75, but although the money was earned for the project, the renovation for one reason or another never took place. However, thanks to Nancy Lynn, Catherine Browne, and Mayor George Seibels, the park was awarded the Birmingham Beautification Award in 1997 that protects the Villa as a preserve.</font></p><p></p>
